# ch57x Keyboard Mapping Tool 
## Utility for programming custom keymaps in macrokeyboards commonly found on AliExpress
### Thanks and Credit to: https://github.com/kriomant/ch57x-keyboard-tool for developing the tool

Repo contains my `mapping.yaml` file along with the `example-mapping.yaml` file from the tools author

Currently my `mapping.yaml` file is written for a `3x1 with 1 knob` macro keyboard 
 - the config will frequently change as I experiment with different mappings
 - the `3x1 with 1 knob` keyboard has limitations on the placment of modifier keys
    - see [creators readme](https://github.com/kriomant/ch57x-keyboard-tool#notes) for details
